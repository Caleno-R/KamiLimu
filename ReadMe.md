# An Introduction to Git and Github

## What is Git?
Simply put, Git is an extremely popular *version control system* used on wide variety of high-profile projects. Linus Torvalds created Git in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel.

To understand Git, look at the following scenarios that developers faced before:

- Developers normally submitted their codes to the central server without having copies of their own
- Any changes made to the source code were unknown to the other developers
- There was no communication between any of the developers

That was **tough!** because, how were conflicts resolved? After the introduction of Git is the developer's space:

- Every developer has an entire copy of the code on their local systems
- Any changes made to the source code can be tracked by others
- There is regular communication between the developers

Git is generally used for **source code management** in software development.

### Git Installation
Git is installed and maintained on your local system which gives you a self-contained record of your ongoing programming versions. It can be used completely *exclusive of any cloud-hosting service* â€” you donâ€™t even need internet access, except to download it. That is so cool, right! ðŸ˜Ž

Compared to other version control systems, Git is absolutely free, responsive and easy to use. Git is also specially designed to work well with text files â€” which, if you think about it, is what code actually is. For code, git specifically allows you to:
1. Track your history
2. Creates backups for code.
3. Collaborate with other developers

And my best, a feature that sets Git apart is...
4. **Branching.** 

Branching allows you to create independent local branches in your code. This means you can try out new ideas, set aside branches for production work, jump back to earlier branches, and easily delete, merge, and recall branches at the click of a button. You can do your work on a branch while the main branch (master) remains stable. After you are done with your work, you can merge it with the main office.

And thatâ€™s it. Git is a high-quality version control system.



GitHub is designed as a Git repository hosting service.GitHub hosts Git repositories and provides developers with tools to ship better code through command line features, issues (threaded discussions), pull requests, code review, or the use of a collection of free and for-purchase apps in the GitHub Marketplace. Unlike Git, GitHub is exclusively cloud-based. Also unlike Git, GitHub is a for-profit service (although basic repository-hosting features are available at no cost to those who are willing to create a user profile, making GitHub a popular choice for open-source projects). With collaboration layers like the GitHub flow, a community of 15 million developers, and an ecosystem with hundreds of integrations, GitHub changes the way software is built.GitHub builds collaboration directly into the development process. Work is organized into repositories where developers can outline requirements or direction and set expectations for team members. Then, using the GitHub flow, developers simply create a branch to work on updates, commit changes to save them, open a pull request to propose and discuss changes, and merge pull requests once everyone is on the same page.


Redux is a predictable state container designed to help you write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments and are easy to test.While itâ€™s mostly used as a state management tool with React, you can use it with any other JavaScript framework or library. Itâ€™s lightweight at 2KB (including dependencies), so you donâ€™t have to worry about it making your applicationâ€™s asset size bigger.With Redux, the state of your application is kept in a store, and each component can access any state that it needs from this store.State management is essentially a way to facilitate communication and sharing of data across components. It creates a tangible data structure to represent the state of your app that you can read from and write to. That way, you can see otherwise invisible states while youâ€™re working with them. State management gets messy as the app gets complex. This is why you need a state management tool like Redux that makes it easier to maintain these states. When using Redux with React, states will no longer need to be lifted up. This makes it easier for you to trace which action causes any change. ALso remember that Redux makes the state predictable, is maintainable and debugging is easy in Redux.
